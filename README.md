# 👨‍💻 Software Engineering Student

Hi there! I'm a Software Engineering student passionate about learning the flow of software development and maintenance. My journey in this field has been driven by a fascination with how software systems are built, evolve, and continue to function over time. I'm excited to deepen my knowledge and apply practical skills in this course, which focuses on the often overlooked but critical area of software maintenance.
